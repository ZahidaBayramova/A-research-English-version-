Artificial Intelligence (AI) Ethical Issues Research

Artificial Intelligence is a widely spread, beneficial, and at the same time dangerous system. It is particularly evident in industries like manufacturing, transportation, and services. It raises questions related to increasing unemployment, ethical impacts, and social injustice.

At the same time, AI systems collect, process, and analyze large volumes of data. This data may include personal information, user behavior, and even healthcare data. The improper management of data and the risk of misuse of personal information causes concerns among people. According to research conducted by McKinsey and Company, it is estimated that 800 million jobs worldwide may be lost due to AI applications. Research by Oxford Economics predicts that by 2030, 20 million jobs in the U.S. alone could be lost.

It is also widespread in the service sector. According to a 2020 report by PwC, 42 percent of companies use AI for customer services. Gartner predicted in 2021 that 25percent of customer service activities would be automated, resulting in 5percent of customer service workers losing their jobs.

AI can threaten human rights. An example of this would be the legal and ethical issues arising from the incorrect results of facial recognition technology. AI, especially in applications like automated surveillance and security tools, increases control over people. Ethical concerns about these technologies raise issues related to human rights violations and the protection of privacy.

The impact of AI on death and suicide events and the necessity of its emotional connection with humans bring ethical and social issues to the forefront in various fields of society. This topic raises important questions regarding both the development of AI and people's emotional and psychological health. A study from 2018 found that 60percent of young people reported that on AI-managed social media platforms, ads and content were shown based on their mood, potentially leading to increased social isolation and depression.

The boundary between humanity and machines: Ethical debates surrounding the development of AI focus on whether machines should replicate the functions of the human brain and decision-making abilities. Every AI decision sometimes creates problems related to preserving or violating human rights and ethics.

The future of AI and its dangers: Like every development, there are ethical debates about the future of AI. It is necessary to find answers to questions regarding AI potentially replacing humans or manipulating their decisions. Issues like superintelligent AI or machines making autonomous decisions remain an ethical topic.

The problem of AI acceptance in society: The role of AI in society depends on how people accept it. This can lead to different emotional and ethnic issues. Social perception and ethical issues are essential for the successful implementation of this technology.

Creating ethical guidelines: International and local normative legal frameworks should be established for the ethical use of AI. These frameworks aim to protect both technological development and human rights.
